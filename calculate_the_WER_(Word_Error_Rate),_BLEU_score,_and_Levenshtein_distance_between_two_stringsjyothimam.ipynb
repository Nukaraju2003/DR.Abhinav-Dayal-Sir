        "textwhispersmall = \"Tell me about yourself. Good afternoon ma'am. I am Radha Laveerabhargavi from West Dakota Valley and currently I am pursuing my B.Tech final year in Vishnu Institute of Technology with CGPA 9.12. I have completed my intermediate in SESI junior college with 96% and I completed my 10th with 93% in Nagarjuna school. Coming to my family, my family includes my father who is a horticulturist, my mother who is a homemaker, and my sister currently pursuing her intermediate and I love playing badminton. I have good knowledge in Java and Python and I'm also interested in machine learning. I have completed two decent projects called screen recording application using Python and exploratory data analysis on engineering placements. What is your role in projects? My role is developing the application member. Like what technologies you have used for the development of your projects? I have used libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Open CD. Technology in the sense you should mention which programming language you have used. I have used Python language. Is the growing of technology good for humans or not? Yes ma'am, growing of technology is good for humans in one way and in other ways, it leads to some consequences like data security is not possible if we have more technology. And you said that you are interested in machine learning. Like every person can be replaced by an artificial machine. Then what is your opinion on that? It is a boon for people having any disabilities ma'am. But in some way, it leads to unemployment. Okay. Would you prefer hard work or smart work? I prefer both which are suitable for the condition. Try to elaborate it with an example at least. Like if we want to achieve something we need some patience and in that time, we need hard work ma'am. But in multitasking we use smart work. What made you choose the IT sector? IT sector is growing ma'am. Every day we have new technology and we can learn new things. Are you interested for relocation of your job? Yes, ma'am. Are you comfortable with rotational shifts like day shift and night shift? Yes, ma'am. I will be comfortable with rotational shifts. Okay, let's move with the technical side. Explain about OOP concepts. OOPs is an object-oriented programming which we can store the data in the form of objects and classes and it has four main principles like extraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. What is the difference between union and structure in C language? Right now I don't know the exact answer. I have only, I have no, only the basics of C language. What is a static variable? Static variable can be used for three types. It can be used for class, method, and variable. If we use static for a variable, the variable cannot be changed and if we use static for a method, the method cannot be overridden and if we use it as a class, the class cannot be. What are different aggregation functions in SQL? Max min sum count. Can you explain about descending order in SQL? How we can implement descending order? We can implement by using it in group by. By using a keyword. What is normalization? Normalization is dividing tables into small tables which can be decomposed form. What is data redundancy? Data redundancy is having multiple copies. What is the second normal form? I do not know. Explain about inheritance and its types. Inheritance is the situation when child class inherits the properties from the parent class. Inheritance types are multiple inheritance, multilevel inheritance, single inheritance, hybrid inheritance. Whether Python support all types of inheritance like Java. What is a constructor? Constructor is nothing but the instance of class which can have the same name of class and it does not contain any return type. Okay. Can you explain the logic for string reverse, implementation of string reverse? Yes ma'am. It is like minus index map we use, call and call and minus 1. Explain polymorphism with real life examples. Polymorphism means having many forms map. For example, water map, water has many forms, it is like solid, gas and liquid. What is the use of final keyword in Java? What is a strong number? Strong number means the sum of factorial of given digits of a number is equal to the given number. Where do you want to watch yourself in the next 5 years? I want to become a software professional model. Do you have any role model? I have a role model Abdul Kalab. Why? Because from childhood he faced many challenges and although he can be successful in his life. Okay fine.\"\n",

I am Radha Laveerabhargavi from West Dakota Valley and currently, I am pursuing my B.Tech final year in Vishnu Institute of Technology with CGPA 9.12. I have completed my intermediate in SESI junior college with 96% and I completed my 10th with 93% in Nagarjuna school. Coming to my family, my family includes my father who is a horticulturist, my mother who is a homemaker, and my sister currently pursuing her intermediate and I love playing badminton. I have good knowledge in Java and Python and I'm also interested in machine learning. I have completed two decent projects called screen recording application using Python and exploratory data analysis on engineering placements. What is your role in projects? My role is developing the application member. Like what technologies you have used for the development of your projects? I have used libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Open CD. Technology in the sense you should mention which programming language you have used. I have used Python language. Is the growing of technology good for humans or not? Yes ma'am, growing of technology is good for humans in one way and in other ways, it leads to some consequences like data security is not possible if we have more technology. And you said that you are interested in machine learning. Like every person can be replaced by an artificial machine. Then what is your opinion on that? It is a boon for people having any disabilities ma'am. But in some way, it leads to unemployment. Okay. Would you prefer hard work or smart work? I prefer both which are suitable for the condition. Try to elaborate it with an example at least. Like if we want to achieve something we need some patience and in that time, we need hard work ma'am. But in multitasking we use smart work. What made you choose the IT sector? IT sector is growing ma'am. Every day we have new technology and we can learn new things. Are you interested for relocation of your job? Yes, ma'am. Are you comfortable with rotational shifts like day shift and night shift? Yes, ma'am. I will be comfortable with rotational shifts. Okay, let's move with the technical side. Explain about OOP concepts. OOPs is an object-oriented programming which we can store the data in the form of objects and classes and it has four main principles like extraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. What is the difference between union and structure in C language? Right now I don't know the exact answer. I have only, I have no, only the basics of C language. What is a static variable? Static variable can be used for three types. It can be used for class, method, and variable. If we use static for a variable, the variable cannot be changed and if we use static for a method, the method cannot be overridden and if we use it as a class, the class cannot be. What are different aggregation functions in SQL? Max min sum count. Can you explain about descending order in SQL? How we can implement descending order? We can implement by using it in group by. By using a keyword. What is normalization? Normalization is dividing tables into small tables which can be decomposed form. What is data redundancy? Data redundancy is having multiple copies. What is the second normal form? I do not know. Explain about inheritance and its types. Inheritance is the situation when child class inherits the properties from the parent class. Inheritance types are multiple inheritance, multilevel inheritance, single inheritance, hybrid inheritance. Whether Python support all types of inheritance like Java. What is a constructor? Constructor is nothing but the instance of class which can have the same name of class and it does not contain any return type. Okay. Can you explain the logic for string reverse, implementation of string reverse? Yes ma'am. It is like minus index map we use, call and call and minus 1. Explain polymorphism with real life examples. Polymorphism means having many forms map. For example, water map, water has many forms, it is like solid, gas and liquid. What is the use of final keyword in Java? What is a strong number? Strong number means the sum of factorial of given digits of a number is equal to the given number. Where do you want to watch yourself in the next 5 years? I want to become a software professional model. Do you have any role model? I have a role model Abdul Kalab. Why? Because from childhood he faced many challenges and although he can be successful in his life. Okay fine.\"\n",

I have completed two decent projects called screen recording application using Python and exploratory data analysis on engineering placements. What is your role in projects? My role is developing the application. Like what technologies you have used for the development of your projects? I have used libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and OpenCD. Technology in the sense you should mention which programming language you have used. I have used Python and this. Okay, is growing of technology is good for human or not? Yes ma'am, growing of technology is good for human in one way and in other way it leads to some consequences ma'am like data security is not possible if we have more technology ma'am. And you said that you are interested in machine learning. Like every person can be replaced by an artificial machine. Then what is your opinion on that? It is a boon for people having any disabilities ma'am. But in some way it leads to unemployment ma'am. Okay. Would you prefer hard work or smart work? I prefer both which is suitable to condition try to elaborate it with an example at least like if we want to achieve something we need some patience and in that time, we need hard work ma'am but in multitasking we use smart work what made you to choose IT sector IT sector is growing ma'am everything. Every day we have new technology and we can learn new things. Are you interested for relocation of your job? Yes ma'am. Are you comfortable with rotational shifts like day shift and night shift? Yes ma'am. I will be comfortable with rotational shifts. Okay, let's move with the technical side. Explain about OOP concepts. OOP is Object Oriented Programming which we can store the data in the form of objects and classes. And it has four main principles like abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. What is the difference between union and structure in C language? Right now I don't know the exact answer. I have only, I have know only the basics of C language. Okay, what is a static variable? Static variable can be used for three types. It can be used for class, method, and variable. If we use static for variable, the variable can't be changed. And if we use static for method, the method can't be overridden. And if we use it as a class, the class can't be inherited. What are different aggregation functions in SQL? Max, min, sum, count Can you explain about descending order in SQL? How we can implement descending order? We can implement by using it in group by By using a keyword What is normalization? Normalization is dividing tables into small tables which can be in decomposed form. What is data redundancy? Data redundancy is having multiple copies. What is the second normal form? Explain about inheritance and its types. Inheritance is the situation when child class inherits the properties from the parent class. Inheritance types are multiple inheritance, multi-level inheritance, single inheritance, hybrid inheritance. Whether python support all types of inheritance like Java? Java does not support all types of inheritance, ma'am, but Python supports all types of inheritance. What is a constructor? Constructor is nothing but a instance of class which can have same name of class and it does not contain any written type. Okay. Can you explain me the logic for string reverse, implementation of string reverse? Yes, ma'am. In Python, we use... index for the string reverse it's like minus index ma'am we use column column minus one explain polymorphism with real life examples polymorphism means having many forms ma'am for example water ma'am water has many forms it's like solid gas and liquid ok what is the use of final keyword in java What is a strong number? Strong number means the sum of factorial of given digits of a number is equal to the given number. Where do you want to watch yourself in the next 5 years? I want to become a software professional. Do you have any role model? I have role model Abdul Kalam. Why? Because from childhood he faced many challenges and although he can be successful in his life. Okay, fine.\"\n",
